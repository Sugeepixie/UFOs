# UFO Challenge
## Overview of Project
The Purpose of this project was to create a web page with ability to filterUFO sightins on different criteria.
The webpage is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. In addition to the Date filter, filters like City, State, Country, and Shape are added.

## Results:

## Summary
### Drawback: 
 * The user should know the specific dates or shapes to search. Some of the shapes like formative, fireball is not common unless the person knows it exists in the data.
 * If space is indvertently iserted next to city, state or shape, no results are displayed.

 * If upper case letters are entered, no results are displayed.

### Recommendations: 
 1. Addition of function to catch spaces at end of the words would allow for better search
 2. Search criteria by month instead of a specific date would be user friendly to bring up all the sightings that happened during the month than to go by specific day.
